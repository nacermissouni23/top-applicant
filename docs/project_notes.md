# Project Notes: Top Applicant

## Project Idea
The goal is to move beyond simple keyword counting in job descriptions. By leveraging NLP and unsupervised learning, we aim to discover how "Software Engineer" in one region or industry differs from another, and what "hidden" skills are consistently grouped together.

## Initial Assumptions
- Job descriptions contain a mix of boilerplate text and role-specific requirements.
- Certain industries have highly standardized vocabularies, while others are more fragmented.
- Geographic location significantly influences the salary-skill elasticity.

## Questions to Answer
- Can we automatically group job descriptions into "archetypes" that reflect reality better than job titles?
- Which specific technical skills are most correlated with seniority across different regions?
- How much "noise" (soft skills, company culture fluff) exists in typical descriptions, and can it be filtered out effectively?

## Future Extension Ideas
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze descriptions over a time period to see skill decay or growth.
- **Resume Matching**: Build a prototype that compares a resume against the discovered archetypes.
- **Global Heatmap**: Visualize skill demand across different continents.
