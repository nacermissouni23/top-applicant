# Project Notes: Top Applicant

## Project Idea
Top Applicant: Build ideal CVs in data science, machine learning, AI, and related fields by analyzing job trends and high-performing profiles. Highlight the key skills, experiences, and qualifications needed to define a “top applicant,” providing users with a reference to design their own career roadmaps.

## Initial Assumptions
- Job descriptions contain a mix of boilerplate text and role-specific requirements.
- Certain industries have highly standardized vocabularies, while others are more fragmented.
- Geographic location significantly influences the salary-skill elasticity.

## Questions to Answer
- Can we automatically group job descriptions into "archetypes" that reflect reality better than job titles?
- Which specific technical skills are most correlated with seniority across different regions?
- How much "noise" (soft skills, company culture fluff) exists in typical descriptions, and can it be filtered out effectively?

## Future Extension Ideas
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze descriptions over a time period to see skill decay or growth.
- **Resume Matching**: Build a prototype that compares a resume against the discovered archetypes.
- **Global Heatmap**: Visualize skill demand across different continents.
