    "## Mathematical Overview\n",
    "The TF-IDF weight for a term $t$ in a document $d$ within a corpus $D$ is calculated as:\n",

    "## IO\n",
    "- **Input**: Preprocessed corpus from `data/processed/`.\n",
    "- **Output**: Feature matrices and sparse vectors for machine learning models.\n"
